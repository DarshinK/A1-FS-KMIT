switch case ->
i) If there is default at beginning and no breaks then default get's 

final int x can be passed a method arg so that the value of x cannot be modified.

final String[] names = new String[1]; // reference is final
names[0] = "viishhnu"
// the above line doesn't give you a error since names is pointing to a object in heap which is final that means it reference cannot be changed

String is not Iterable unlike ArrayList , so for string we cannot use for each 
We can use for-each only for a collection or Iterable object

String is both wrapper and primitive so by default it's value is null when we printing , but when we call it with a method we get 
Null Pointer Exception 

String[] ar = new String[] ;
for(String s : ar){
    sop(s); // null null null 
    sop(s.length()); // gives Null Pointer Exception 
}

You cannot instatitiate a interface and a abstract class
