/*
You are tasked with calculating the minimum cost to travel between a series of 
buildings arranged in a straight line. There are n buildings, numbered from 1 
to n, and each building has an associated cost. 

The cost represents the expense incurred when you stop at a particular building.

You are allowed to jump between buildings, but the maximum jump length is limited
to k buildings. Whenever you stop at a building, the cost of that building is 
added to your total cost. The objective is to determine the minimum total cost 
required to travel from the first building to the n-th (destination) building.

Input Format:
-------------
Two space separated integers, N and K.
N space separated integers, costs[], to reach buildings.

Output Format:
--------------
An integer result, minimum total cost.
